## Q1 — Vision Transformer on CIFAR-10
### Goal
Implement a ViT from scratch (patch embedding, positional embeddings, CLS token, Transformer encoder blocks with MHSA + MLP + residual + norm) and achieve strong test accuracy on CIFAR-10.

### High-Level Summary
All core architectural components (patchify, class token, learnable positional embeddings, multi-head self-attention, MLP blocks, residual connections, layer normalization, output head) are implemented manually in PyTorch (no using `timm` ViT directly). Best test accuracy achieved: **90.51%** after 200 epochs.

### How to Run (Colab)
1. Open `q1.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Runtime → Change runtime type → select GPU.
3. Run the first cell to install dependencies:
```python
!pip install torch torchvision timm matplotlib
```
4. Run all cells sequentially (training will start automatically, uses OneCycleLR scheduler).
5. Final test accuracy is printed at the end.

### Best Model Configuration
| Hyperparameter | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Patch size | 4×4 |
| Positional embeddings | Learnable |
| CLS token | Prepended |
| Latent dimension | 384 |
| Encoder layers | 6 |
| Attention heads | 6 |
| MLP hidden dim | 4× latent (1536) |
| Dropout | 0.1 |
| Optimizer | AdamW (lr = 1e-3) |
| Scheduler | OneCycleLR (pct_start=0.1, cosine) |
| Weight decay | 0.1 |
| Batch size | 128 |
| Epochs | 200 |
| Augmentations | RandomCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip, RandAugment (n=2,m=9), CutMix (p=0.5), MixUp (α=0.4) |
| Label smoothing | 0.15 |
| Weight init | Default PyTorch |
| Final test accuracy | **90.51%** |

### Results Table (Ablations / Bonus Experiments)
| Model / Exp | Key Variation | Configuration Highlights | Test Accuracy |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| q1 (baseline) | Main run | 6 layers, dim=384, heads=6, RandAug + CutMix + MixUp, OneCycleLR | **90.51%** |
| exp-1 | ViT-style init | Truncated normal (σ=0.02) | 80.27% |
| exp-2 | Increased depth | 8 encoder layers (others same) | 89.15% |
| exp-3 | Wider model | Latent dim=512, heads=8 | 89.80% |
| exp-4 | Stronger aug | Overlapping patches (stride=2), RandAug (n=3,m=15), MixUp α=0.6 | 90.00% |
| exp-5 | Longer training | 300 epochs, warmup 10, cosine decay, lr div factor=100 | 90.40% |

### Bonus Analysis (Concise)
- **Initialization (exp-1)**: Truncated-normal (ViT paper style) hurt convergence on CIFAR-10 → large drop to 80.27%; small-data regime favors PyTorch defaults.
- **Depth (exp-2)**: +2 layers improved capacity but offered diminishing returns; required stronger regularization beyond 6 layers.
- **Width (exp-3)**: Dim=512 increased parameters (~1.7×) but only modest uplift; needed lower LR (5e-4) for stability.
- **Aggressive Aug (exp-4)**: Overlapping patches + stronger RandAug/MixUp improved robustness but small net gain vs baseline.
- **Longer Schedule (exp-5)**: 300 epochs produced marginal +0. -0.1% improvement over 200; sweet spot ~200–250 epochs.

### Key Implementation Notes
- Manual patch extraction (unfold) or reshape path (depending on final code) without high-level ViT wrappers.
- Augmentation blend (CutMix + MixUp + RandAugment) stabilized training and reduced overfitting.
- OneCycleLR accelerated early convergence and helped reach near-peak accuracy before epoch 150.
- Label smoothing (0.15) improved calibration and modestly boosted accuracy.

### Potential Future Improvements
- EMA of weights
- Knowledge distillation from larger pretrained ViT
- Token pruning or dynamic depth
- Advanced regularizers (Stochastic Depth / DropPath)

## Q2 — Text-Driven Image Segmentation with SAM 2
### Goal
Given an image and a natural language prompt, produce an object segmentation mask via text → region grounding (CLIPSeg) followed by refinement using SAM 2. (Bonus: video object segmentation.)

### Pipeline Overview
1. Install dependencies + clone `facebookresearch/sam2`.
2. Load CLIPSeg (`CIDAS/clipseg-rd64-refined`) for prompt-conditioned heatmap.
3. Threshold + morphological cleanup → binary seed mask.
4. Derive seeds: bounding box + sampled foreground points.
5. Run SAM 2 multimask inference; optionally fallback to original SAM (ViT-H) if SAM 2 load fails.
6. Score candidate masks by (CLIPSeg overlap × SAM score) and select best.
7. Visualize: original | heatmap | initial mask | refined masks | final overlay | mask-only.

### Bonus Video Extension
- Extract frames (stride or fps-based sampling).
- First-frame segmentation seeds propagation.
- Per-frame re-grounding via CLIPSeg + SAM refinement (reduces drift).
- Fallback: previous-mask bbox + IoU gating.
- Synthetic + multi-object test videos; optional MP4 overlay export.

### Core Classes
| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `ImprovedTextDrivenSegmentationSAM2` | Image pipeline: CLIPSeg grounding, seed extraction, SAM 2 refinement, visualization. |
| `VideoTextSegmentationSAM2` | Video frame extraction, temporal propagation, overlay generation. |
| `SegmentationEvaluator` | IoU, Dice, Precision, Recall, F1, coverage, basic ground-truth synthesis for synthetic shapes. |
| `ComprehensiveTestSuite` | Runs real-world, synthetic, multi-object, threshold analysis, and generates plots. |

### Prompt-to-Mask Strategies
- Combined bounding box + multi-point sampling from contours.
- Overlap weighting: `combined_score = overlap_with_clipseg_heatmap * sam_score`.
- Fallback to CLIPSeg mask if SAM candidates fail.

### Robustness Measures
- Morphological close → open to denoise masks.
- Contour area filter (>500 px) pruning small artifacts.
- Graceful logging when no detection; suggests threshold adjustments.

### Evaluation Components
- Real-world images: dog, cat, car, person, flower (multi-prompts & thresholds).
- Synthetic shapes: circle, square, triangle, diamond, hexagon (color-aware prompts).
- Multi-object video (three simultaneous shapes).
- Threshold sweep: 0.10–0.65 (step 0.05).
- Plot suite (9 panels) summarizing success, coverage, timing, thresholds, and multi-object results.

### Metrics Implemented
- IoU, Dice, Precision, Recall, F1
- Foreground coverage ratio
- Processing time & success flag

### How to Run (Colab)
1. Open `q2.ipynb` in Colab (GPU recommended).
2. Run install + clone cells at top.
3. Run class definition cells.
4. Quick image test:
```python
segmenter = ImprovedTextDrivenSegmentationSAM2()
segmenter.process("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518717758536-85ae29035b6d?w=800", "dog", clipseg_threshold=0.35)
```
5. Synthetic video test:
```python
video_segmenter = VideoTextSegmentationSAM2(segmenter)
video_segmenter.process_video("synthetic_circle.mp4", "green circle", max_frames=10, threshold=0.3)
```
6. Full test harness:
```python
segmenter, video_segmenter = run_comprehensive_tests()
# or
test_suite, results = run_comprehensive_evaluation()
```

### Strengths
- End-to-end reproducible with fallback resilience.
- Multi-strategy seeding improves SAM mask quality.
- Video temporal module (bonus) with re-grounding reduces drift.
- Large evaluation breadth (synthetic + real + multi-object + thresholds).
- Clear modular structure enabling future extensions.

### Limitations
- CLIPSeg can miss fine-grained attributes / multi-instance objects.
- Single-prompt, single-object focus (no simultaneous multi-object segmentation in one pass).
- External checkpoint URLs are SPOFs (no checksum / mirror).
- Overlap scoring heuristic is not learned; could mis-rank ambiguous regions.
- Runtime of comprehensive suite (10–15+ minutes) is high for fast iteration.
- No caching of downloads / intermediate features.
- Binary threshold not adaptive; no CRF/boundary refinement.
- Memory usage may spike on large images or higher resolution videos.

### Future Improvements
- Integrate GroundingDINO / GLIP for stronger initial boxes.
- Negative prompts & multi-object parsing (noun phrase decomposition).
- Optical flow or tracker-based temporal smoothing.
- Learned fusion / lightweight refinement head.
- CRF / boundary snapping post-processing.
- Interactive Gradio Web UI.
- Result caching + artifact logging.

### Failure Modes & Mitigations
| Failure | Current Mitigation |
|---------|--------------------|
| Empty CLIPSeg mask | Suggest lower threshold / different prompt |
| SAM 2 load failure | Automatic fallback to SAM (ViT-H) |
| Temporal drift | Re-ground each frame + IoU gating |
| Noisy small blobs | Morphological ops + contour area threshold |
| Ambiguous prompt | Encourage more specific text (user guidance) |

### Summary Statement
This segmentation framework fuses CLIPSeg grounding with SAM 2 refinement and extends naturally to video through re-grounded temporal propagation, delivering a flexible and analyzable platform for text-driven segmentation research.
